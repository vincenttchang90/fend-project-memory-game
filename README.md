Memory Game - By: Vincent Chang

General:
This game is a 16 card memory test for the player. The game tracks time and number of moves a player needs to reach completion and awards a star rating based on performance.
Completing the game within 12 moves earns 3 stars, 16 moves earns 2, and greater than 16 is awarded 1 star. You may restart at anytime. Good luck!

1. Open index.html
2. Click on a card to begin game (timer starts on first click).
3. Try to pair all the cards in the least amount of moves possible!
